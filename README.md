Web Development Class

Document your knowledge of Git, WebStorm, and GitHub by creating a step by step tutorial in your readme file. You need to make a tutorial that you could give to someone else that describes the process of how to use Git and Github. You outside resources as well as my PowerPoint presentations. Cite all references and put the Reference list at the end of the document.

You must include definitions for the following terms in your writeup:

GIT

GITHUB

Repository

Clone

Commit

Push

Pull

Branch

Merge

Merge Conflict

Fetch

Remote

Your commits should have clear messages like:


Task: Create Repository

Feature:  added workflow for using github

Fix:  changed readme.md for definition of terms
